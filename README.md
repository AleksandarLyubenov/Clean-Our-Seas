# Clean Our Seas

This is my first semi-serious project, created for the intake for Creative Media and Game Technologies.
It focuses on a submarine, cleaning up the ocean as per Sustainable Development Goal 14 of the United Nations, that also being the theme of the game. There is also wildlife that the player must protect while cleaning.
